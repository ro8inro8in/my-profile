        <article>I am a freelance audio editor, my experience in the music
            industry spans over ten years,
            from being a touring musician, composing, releasing records, producing, mixing and mastering. I started
            playing music
            when I was around ten years old, dabbling in multiple instruments. I ended up focusing on playing the
            guitar.<br><br>
            To begin
            with, my Dad taught me how to play guitar, later I moved on to college to further my education in musical
            composition. When
            I
            finished
            college I went on to university, I moved my focus to music production and sound engineering,
            since then I have worked on many projects in various
            aspects utilising
            all my skills with a main focus on live performance and production, This continued to evolve year after
            year until
            recently where I spent two years touring around Europe, unfortunately to the demise of the band we all
            stopped. I decided
            to focus on production and that brings me to now where I have been working as a freelance Audio editor my
            most recent
            projects are
            online corporate videos for companies such as
